## Introduction
Real estate industry has intrigued us long enough that we want to figure out what the determinant factors are of the price of a house. Do the real estate agencies just make a number up as price, or do they price with some sorts of standards? And if so, our goal is to figure out the pricing standard in the real estate industry, and pinpoint those which are overpriced(not suggested to invest) and underpriced(please sieze the chance to invest). Interested in both statistics and economics, our group decides to applying statistical methods to predict housing price, and determine the factors that affect the value of houses and properties with modeling.

## Objectives
The project objectives are:
- Predicting the housing price in Saratoga, New York, 2006,
- identifying houses that are extraordinarily expensive(overpriced) or inexpensive(underpriced),
- and pinpointing factors that affect the housing price in Saratoga, New York, 2006.

## Team
This project also served as the final project of STAT 420: Statistical Modeling in R in collaboration with Mingjie Wang and Ruopu Fan.
